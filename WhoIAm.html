                <p>Who am I? This is a question that I should ask myself everyday. It’s a question that helps me to evaluate my life, and what it means to me. In order to complete this personal evaluation, I will split my life into three categories: spiritual, mental, and my view of life. I would consider myself a very spiritual person. Both my parents were raised as strong Christians, and I’ve been brought up the same way. In my younger years, religion was a significant part of my life. It has been the foundation to which I’ve based my morals. However, after High School my spiritual life has changed dramatically. I feel more independent as a Christian, and can explore my own beliefs without feeling pressure from others within the church. My independence has driven me to study different religious views on such topics as creation, evolution, and interpretations of the Bible. My beliefs still remain the same, but I have become more open minded to other views. I am able to listen to others, and understand what they are trying to explain. My independence as a Christian has helped me to improve my education and broaden my view of other opinions. I am the type of person who likes to walk the walk, and take action in my life. I look at life, especially at this age, as a time to experience new things. A time to get away from the same everyday routine, and enjoy the short time we have on earth. I am the type of person who likes to set goals. Whether it’s to run my own business someday, or just to bring a friend back to church. Some of my goals may seem unrealistic, but it will always give me something to aim for. If I could describe myself in two words, it would be dedicated and relaxed. Dedication is a very important part in my life. I believe that being dedicated helps to employ good work ethics in people, which is something this world is lacking at times.<br></p>
